This is the first LKM Module

As tradition I have created Hello World

Also I want to learn how to use git


To Add all files we can use git add -A

Lets change something

If next time you cant push to remote then use below command
git config --global http.sslverify false

To commit changes to server 
git push origin master

But if this the first time and you have not cloned then

git remote add origin https://github.com/hemantkapoor/helloWorld.git
